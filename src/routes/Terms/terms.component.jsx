                    These are my standard terms of service for any design or development project. Have a good read through, and if anything jumps out at you as a potential issue, let me know before the project begins and we can discuss any alterations that might be needed for your particular project.

                            <div className="subtitle-block">Deposits, final payments and delivery</div>

                            <p className="text-block">I reserve the right to request a 50% deposit prior to starting work on your project. If a deposit is requested, an invoice will be generated and delivered to you via email and payment is expected within 30 days of issue. By remitting deposit funds you are accepting these Terms of Service and entering a contract with <span className='highlight'>Prathamesh Bankar</span>.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">I will invoice for the remaining cost of the project and associated services prior to the release of any design files or final exports. I reserve the right to withhold delivery until payment has been received in full.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">I reserve the right to invoice prior to the time detailed if you have been uncontactable/unresponsive for more than 30 days.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">You may reserve the right to request a payment plan which may be accepted at my discretion. All payment plans must be agreed to both parties in writing.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">All payments are to be made within 30 days of issue.</p>

                            <p className="text-block"> I reserve the right to charge you for any fees incurred relating to commencement of collection and recovery processes for accounts that remain unpaid in excess of 30 days.</p>

                            <div className="subtitle-block">Licensing of any used fonts or typefaces</div>

                            <p className="text-block">Any fonts/typefaces that are purchased for the UI design, final logo, and/or supporting brand identity assets, are subject to commercial licensing laws. A font/typeface licence gives <span className='highlight'>only</span> the owner full rights to use the font/typeface as necessary.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">In my initial presentation of concepts, I will provide information of the typefaces used and where they can be acquired. It is the responsibility of the client to acquire any necessary font licenses (paid or unpaid), so please bear this in mind when approving designs.</p>

                            <p className="text-block"><span className='highlight'>It is against the law for me to provide any client a ‘copy’ of any font/typeface that I own, and have personally purchased. </span></p>

                            <p className="text-block">If you would like to use a copy of a font/typeface that I have purchased, to be used commercially, you must purchase the respective font/typeface licence, and register it in your name.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">Typically, a font used in a logo will not need to be licensed, as the graphics are converted to vector artwork and can no longer be edited. However, should you require a font to use in your own artwork for editing purposes, such as on a website or a print presentation, then you will need your own license through a desktop license purchase.</p>
                            
                            <p className="text-block">These can typically be found at:</p>

                            <p className="text-block">I am free to use these unused and previous ideas for future conceptual and client work. Where a previously unused idea/design retains a similar look and style to the finished work, I shall repurpose and style so that the end design is sufficiently different as to not cause conflict.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">Unless otherwise agreed and arranged, I reserve the right to showcase the finished work and associated designs in my portfolio and in any number of online galleries/portfolio/showcases/awards as well as in printed literature including books and magazines, now and in the future. Associated designs and artwork can include commercial print design/business card/stationery design/signage/desktop icons/mobile phone and other portable device application icons and imagery. </p>

                            <p className="text-block">ANY supporting artwork and designs required by this project can be used as indicated by myself for personal and professional reasons.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">If there are issues with final payment, I reserve the right to reuse or amend any of these ideas for other clients, or to be used freely as concepts in my portfolio.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">Should the client attempt to use/modify/alter/replicate or steal any of my ideas without making agreed final payment, I will take immediate legal counsel.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">If you choose to cancel the project midway through, where ideas and proposals have been submitted, refund of previous payment is not possible. However, depending on the work completed and overall budget, a portion of the funds may be returned.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">If I fall ill, or am unable to complete the project due to unforeseen circumstances, a portion of the overall budget will be returned. In most cases the complete amount will be refunded. If any works, so far completed, can be used for another designer to pick up, then a percentage will be refunded based on work completed or any other reasonable suggestion will be considered.</p>

                            <div className="subtitle-block">Project Suspension</div>

                            <p className="text-block">I reserve the right to suspend any project if there is interference with excessive micromanaging, demonstrating a continued lack of trust and inability to move forward after showing more than a reasonable number of unique design ideas/concepts, and/or showing a reluctance in paying the final payment.</p>

                            <p className="text-block">Fair notice will be given with fair chance to remedy the situation without resorting to project suspension or termination. Any suspension, or termination, will not result in any refunds and all designs and work thus developed remain the full ownership of <span className="highlight">Prathamesh Bankar</span>.</p>
